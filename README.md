# Unity Cylinder Collider Generator
An editor script that allows you to create and optionally save cylinder colliders with adjustable variables
CTRL+Z and CTRL+Y undo/redo actions are supported.

You don't need the script to keep the collider working, it's simply a mesh creator/modifier that you can remove after being done with it.
